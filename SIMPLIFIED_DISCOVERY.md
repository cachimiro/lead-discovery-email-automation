# Simplified Lead Discovery - Complete ‚úÖ

Previously, the application had **4 separate pages** for lead discovery, which was confusing and cluttered:

- `/linkedin` - Find by LinkedIn URL

Each page had similar UI, same workflow (AnyMailFinder ‚Üí NeverBounce ‚Üí Stripe), but required navigation between pages.

## Solution Implemented
Created **ONE unified Lead Discovery page** at `/discover` with:
