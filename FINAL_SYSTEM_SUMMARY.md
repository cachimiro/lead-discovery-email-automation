## üìã Setup Checklist

### Required for Production

#### 1. Database Schema (5 minutes)
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- AI Response Analysis Schema
-- File: db/AI_RESPONSE_ANALYSIS_SCHEMA.sql
```

This adds AI analysis columns to your responses table.

#### 2. Environment Variables (5 minutes)
Add to DigitalOcean App Platform:

```bash
# SendGrid (for sending emails)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key
SENDGRID_VERIFIED_SENDER=your-email@domain.com
SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_SECRET=generate-random-secret

# OpenAI (for AI response analysis)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Cron (for automated sending)
CRON_SECRET=generate-random-secret

# Base URLs (already set)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://sway-pr-leads-g4bfk.ondigitalocean.app
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://sway-pr-leads-g4bfk.ondigitalocean.app
APP_BASE_URL=https://sway-pr-leads-g4bfk.ondigitalocean.app
```

#### 3. SendGrid Setup (15 minutes)
See: `SENDGRID_SETUP_COMPLETE.md`

- Create SendGrid account
- Verify sender email
- Create API key
- Set up Inbound Parse webhook
- Configure DNS records

#### 4. Cron Job Setup (10 minutes)
See: `SENDGRID_SETUP_COMPLETE.md`

Set up automated email sending every 5 minutes:
- DigitalOcean App Platform Cron, OR
- External service (Cron-job.org, EasyCron)

## üîÑ How It All Works

### Email Sending Flow

```
1. User logs in (Google/Microsoft)
   ‚Üì
2. User creates campaign
   ‚Üì
3. User adds contacts to campaign
   ‚Üì
4. User starts campaign
   ‚Üì
5. System schedules emails (28/day max, includes follow-ups)
   ‚Üì
6. Cron job runs every 5 minutes
   ‚Üì
7. Pending emails sent via SendGrid
   ‚Üì
8. Status updated to "sent"
   ‚Üì
9. Follow-ups scheduled automatically (3 days later)
```

### Response Monitoring + AI Analysis Flow

```
1. Lead replies to email
   ‚Üì
2. Reply goes to replies@yourdomain.com
   ‚Üì
3. SendGrid forwards to webhook
   ‚Üì
4. System matches reply to original email
   ‚Üì
5. ü§ñ AI analyzes response (GPT-4o-mini)
   - Detects sentiment
   - Categorizes intent
   - Suggests action
   - Assigns priority
   ‚Üì
6. All follow-ups for that lead cancelled
   ‚Üì
7. Response logged with AI insights
   ‚Üì
8. User sees AI analysis in dashboard
```

### Rate Limiting (28 emails/day)

```
Campaign with 100 contacts:
- First email: 100 queued
- Follow-up 1: 100 queued
- Follow-up 2: 100 queued
Total: 300 emails queued

System sends: 28/day (regardless of type)
- Day 1: 28 emails sent
- Day 2: 28 emails sent
- Day 3: 28 emails sent
- ...continues until all sent

If someone replies:
- Their follow-ups cancelled immediately
- Doesn't affect 28/day limit
```

## ü§ñ AI Response Analysis

### What It Does

When someone replies, AI automatically:

1. **Analyzes sentiment:**
   - üòä Positive - They're interested
   - üòû Negative - They're not interested
   - üòê Neutral - Unclear/informational
   - ‚ùì Question - They have questions
   - üèñÔ∏è Out of Office - Auto-reply

2. **Categorizes response:**
   - `interested` - Wants to learn more
   - `not_interested` - Not interested
   - `needs_info` - Needs more information
   - `meeting_request` - Wants to schedule meeting
   - `unsubscribe` - Wants to opt out
   - `bounce` - Email bounced
   - `other` - Doesn't fit categories

3. **Suggests action:**
   - `reply_manually` - You should respond
   - `schedule_meeting` - Send calendar link
   - `send_info` - Send materials
   - `mark_interested` - Add to CRM
   - `mark_not_interested` - Remove
   - `no_action` - No action needed

4. **Assigns confidence:** 0.0 to 1.0 (how sure AI is)

### Example

**Response received:**
```
"Thanks for reaching out! I'd love to learn more. 
Do you have time for a quick call next week?"
```

**AI Analysis:**
```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "category": "interested",
  "confidenceScore": 0.92,
  "summary": "Recipient is interested and wants to schedule a call",
  "suggestedAction": "schedule_meeting"
}
```
