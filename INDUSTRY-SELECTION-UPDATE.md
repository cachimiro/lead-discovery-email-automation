# Industry Selection Update

## ✅ What's Changed

### Smart Industry Selection
The industry dropdown now **only shows industries from your active journalist leads** that are currently in the system.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### When Adding Industry to a Contact:

#### Option 1: Select from Available Industries
- Dropdown shows **only industries from active journalist leads**
- These are industries that will **match immediately**
- Contact will receive first email when campaign starts
- Industries are sorted alphabetically

#### Option 2: Select "Other" for Custom Industry
- Choose "Other" from dropdown
- Text input field appears
- Type any custom industry name
- ⚠️ **Warning shown:** This won't match any journalist leads
- Contact added to campaign but won't get first email until match found

---

## 📋 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You Have Journalist Leads

**Your journalist leads have these industries:**
- Technology
- Healthcare
- Finance

**Industry dropdown shows:**
```
-- Select Industry --
Finance
Healthcare
Technology
Other (type custom)
```

**If you select "Technology":**
- ✅ Matches journalist leads
- ✅ Contact will receive first email
- ✅ All follow-ups scheduled

**If you select "Other" and type "Biotechnology":**
- ⚠️ Doesn't match any journalist leads
- ❌ Contact won't receive first email (yet)
- ✅ All follow-ups still scheduled
- ℹ️ Can add "Biotechnology" journalist leads later

---

### Scenario 2: No Journalist Leads Yet

**You haven't added journalist leads:**

**Industry dropdown shows:**
```
-- Select Industry --
Other (type custom)
```

**Warning displayed:**
> ⚠️ No Journalist Leads: You don't have any active journalist leads with industries. You can still add industries, but contacts won't receive first emails until matching journalist leads are added.

**What happens:**
- Can still add industries to contacts
- All contacts added to campaign
- No first emails sent (no matches)
- All follow-ups still scheduled
- Add journalist leads later to enable first emails

### API Changes

**Preview Endpoint Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "availableIndustries": [
    "Finance",
    "Healthcare", 
    "Technology"
  ],
  "warnings": {
    "contactsWithoutIndustry": [...],
    "contactsWithNonMatchingIndustry": [...]
  }
}
```

### Industry Matching Logic

**For First Email:**
```javascript
// Check if contact industry matches any journalist lead
const hasMatch = journalistLeads.some(j => 
  j.industry && 
  contact.industry &&
  j.industry.toLowerCase() === contact.industry.toLowerCase()
);

// Set email status
emailStatus = hasMatch ? 'pending' : 'on_hold';
```

**For Follow-Up Emails:**
```javascript
// Always pending - no industry check
emailStatus = 'pending';
```

SELECT DISTINCT industry 
FROM cold_outreach_journalist_leads 
WHERE user_id = ?

  AND industry != ''
ORDER BY industry;
```

**Characteristics:**
