# ✅ Campaign Workflow - Implementation Complete

## What You Asked For

> "I want to add the ability to when creating templates is a simple add follow up then I can add that then after that I click save and saves them all not each one individually also when I finish creating my campaign I want to be able to immediately go to a next page where it will let me pick the leads I want to use to outreach and then they will fill up automatically the variables with the journalist leads in the email but if it out of date nothing will send also after selecting the leads I want to outreach I will have 3 displays that will show all 3 email examples I'll look once I press confirm the outreach will begin with the 28 a day logic that is already built"

**Location:** `/campaigns/new`

- Click "Add Follow-up #1" to add first follow-up
