# üî¥ FINAL FIX - Foreign Key Error

## The Problem

You're getting this error:
```
insert or update on table "journalist_leads" violates foreign key constraint "journalist_leads_user_id_fkey"
```

**This means:** The previous migrations didn't fully remove the foreign key constraints.

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION - One-Click Fix

### Run This Single File

**File:** `db/ONE_CLICK_FIX.sql`

This file will:
1. ‚úÖ Drop ALL existing foreign key constraints
2. ‚úÖ Recreate tables WITHOUT foreign keys to auth.users
3. ‚úÖ Set up proper indexes
4. ‚úÖ Enable RLS with permissive policies
5. ‚úÖ Verify the fix worked

### Steps:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. **Copy** the ENTIRE contents of `db/ONE_CLICK_FIX.sql`
3. **Paste** into SQL Editor
4. **Click Run**
5. **Wait** for completion (should take 5-10 seconds)
6. **Check** output - should say "SUCCESS! Tables recreated"

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** This will drop and recreate the tables. Any existing data in these tables will be lost:
- user_profiles
- contacts
- email_templates
- journalist_leads
- email_campaigns

The `leads` table (for discovered emails) is NOT affected.

## After Running the Fix

### 1. Log Out and Log In Again
This will recreate your user profile with the correct UUID.

### 2. Test Adding a Journalist Lead
1. Go to `/journalist-leads`
2. Click "Add New Lead"
3. Fill in:
   - Journalist Name: Test Journalist
   - Publication: Test Publication
   - Subject: Test Subject
   - Industry: Technology
   - Deadline: Tomorrow's date
4. Click Save
5. ‚úÖ Should work without errors!

### 3. Verify in Supabase
```sql
-- Check your user profile exists
SELECT * FROM user_profiles;

-- Check the journalist lead was created
SELECT * FROM journalist_leads;

-- Verify no foreign keys to auth.users
SELECT constraint_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
AND table_schema = 'public'
AND constraint_name LIKE '%user_id%';
```

Should show 0 rows for the last query.

## Why This Happens

The issue is that:
1. Your app generates custom UUIDs from OAuth IDs
2. These UUIDs don't exist in Supabase's `auth.users` table
3. Foreign key constraints require the UUID to exist in `auth.users`
4. Previous migrations tried to drop constraints but they persisted

## What This Fix Does Differently

Instead of trying to drop constraints, it:
1. **Drops the entire tables** (clean slate)
2. **Recreates them** without any foreign keys to auth.users
3. **Only adds foreign keys** between your own tables (email_campaigns ‚Üí journalist_leads, contacts)
4. **Verifies** the fix worked

## Alternative: Manual Fix

If you don't want to drop tables, try this:

```sql
-- Just drop the specific constraint
ALTER TABLE journalist_leads 
DROP CONSTRAINT journalist_leads_user_id_fkey CASCADE;

-- Verify it's gone
SELECT constraint_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
WHERE table_name = 'journalist_leads' 
AND constraint_name = 'journalist_leads_user_id_fkey';
```

Should return 0 rows.

## Still Not Working?

### Check 1: Is the constraint really gone?
```sql
\d journalist_leads
```

Look for "Foreign-key constraints" section. Should NOT show a constraint to auth.users.

### Check 2: Is your user profile created?
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

If no rows, log out and log in again.

### Check 3: What user_id is being used?
Add logging to the API:
```typescript
// In app/api/journalist-leads/route.ts line 21
console.log('Inserting with user_id:', session.user.id);
```

Check server logs to see the UUID being used.

### Check 4: Try manual insert
```sql
-- Get your user_id
SELECT id FROM user_profiles LIMIT 1;

-- Try inserting manually
INSERT INTO journalist_leads (
  user_id,
  journalist_name,
  publication,
  subject,
  industry,
  deadline
) VALUES (
  '<paste-your-user-id>',
  'Test',
  'Test',
  'Test',
  'Tech',
  '2025-12-31'
);
```

If this works, the issue is with the session user_id.

## Summary

**Problem:** Foreign key constraint to auth.users
**Solution:** Drop and recreate tables without the constraint
**File:** `db/ONE_CLICK_FIX.sql`
**Time:** 5 minutes
**Data Loss:** Yes (user_profiles, contacts, email_templates, journalist_leads, email_campaigns)
**Leads Table:** Not affected

## After Fix Works

Once you can add journalist leads:
1. ‚úÖ Add some test contacts
2. ‚úÖ Add some test journalist leads
3. ‚úÖ Create email templates
4. ‚úÖ Try the email matcher
5. ‚úÖ View Sway PR dashboard

Everything should work perfectly!
