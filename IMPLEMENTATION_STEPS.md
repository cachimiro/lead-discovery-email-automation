## Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy Production-Ready System

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Risk Level:** Minimal (with proper testing)

---

## 📦 PHASE 1: DEPENDENCIES & SETUP (Day 1)

### Step 1.1: Install Required Packages

```bash
cd /workspaces/lead-discovery-appSwayPR

# Install SendGrid SDK
npm install @sendgrid/mail

# Install additional dependencies
npm install crypto

# Verify installation
npm list @sendgrid/mail
```

### Step 1.2: Set Up SendGrid Account

1. Go to [https://sendgrid.com/](https://sendgrid.com/)
2. Sign up for account (Free tier: 100 emails/day, Essentials: $19.95/month for 50k emails)
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete sender authentication:
   - Go to Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Authenticate your domain (recommended) OR
   - Create a verified sender email address

### Step 1.3: Get SendGrid API Key

1. Go to Settings → API Keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name: "Lead Discovery App - Production"
4. Permissions: "Full Access" (or "Mail Send" + "Inbound Parse")
5. Copy the API key (you'll only see it once!)

### Step 1.4: Configure Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SENDGRID_VERIFIED_SENDER=mark@swaypr.com
SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-random-secret-here

# Cron Job Security
CRON_SECRET=your-random-cron-secret-here

# Slack Alerts (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
```

Generate random secrets:
```bash
# Generate SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_SECRET
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Generate CRON_SECRET
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

## 🗄️ PHASE 2: DATABASE SETUP (Day 1-2)

### Step 2.1: Run Database Migrations

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the bulletproof schema:

```bash
# Copy the SQL file content
cat db/BULLETPROOF_EMAIL_AUTOMATION_SCHEMA.sql

# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and run
```

3. Verify tables created:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'cold_outreach_%';

-- Should see:
-- cold_outreach_email_queue
-- cold_outreach_sending_schedule
-- cold_outreach_campaign_automation
-- cold_outreach_email_responses
-- cold_outreach_email_log
-- cold_outreach_dead_letter_queue
-- cold_outreach_rate_limit_tracking
```

### Step 2.2: Test Database Functions

```sql
-- Test slot reservation function
SELECT * FROM reserve_email_slot(
  'your-user-id'::uuid,
  CURRENT_DATE
);

-- Should return: slot_reserved = true, slot_number = 1, scheduled_time = today 9am

-- Test follow-up cancellation function
SELECT cancel_follow_ups_for_recipient(
  'test-campaign-id'::uuid,
  'test@example.com'
);
```

### Step 2.3: Set Up Row Level Security

Verify RLS is enabled:

```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename LIKE 'cold_outreach_%';

-- All should show rowsecurity = true
```

---

## 🔧 PHASE 3: SENDGRID CONFIGURATION (Day 2)

### Step 3.1: Configure Inbound Parse

1. Go to SendGrid → Settings → Inbound Parse
2. Click "Add Host & URL"
3. Configure:
   - **Subdomain:** `inbound` (or your choice)
   - **Domain:** `yourdomain.com`
   - **Destination URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/webhook-response`
   - **Check spam:** Yes
   - **Send raw:** No
   - **POST raw MIME:** No

4. Add DNS records (in your domain provider):
   ```
   Type: MX
   Host: inbound.yourdomain.com
   Value: mx.sendgrid.net
   Priority: 10
   ```

5. Test webhook:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/webhook-response \
     -d "from=test@example.com&subject=Test&text=Test body"
   ```

### Step 3.2: Configure Event Webhook (Optional)

For tracking opens, clicks, bounces:

1. Go to Settings → Mail Settings → Event Webhook
2. Enable webhook
3. HTTP Post URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/webhook-events`
4. Select events:
   - Delivered
   - Opened
   - Clicked
   - Bounced
   - Spam Report

---

## ⏰ PHASE 4: CRON JOB SETUP (Day 3)

### Option A: Vercel Cron (Recommended)

1. Create `vercel.json` in project root:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/email-automation/send-batch",
      "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/email-automation/health",
      "schedule": "*/15 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

3. Verify cron jobs in Vercel dashboard

### Option B: External Cron Service

Use [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) or similar:

1. Create account
2. Add job:
   - **URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/send-batch`
   - **Schedule:** Every 5 minutes
   - **HTTP Method:** POST
   - **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET`

3. Add health check job:
   - **URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/health`
   - **Schedule:** Every 15 minutes

## 🧪 PHASE 5: TESTING (Day 4-7)

### Step 5.1: Unit Tests

Run through the testing guide:

```bash
# See BULLETPROOF_TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

### Step 5.2: Integration Tests

Test each API endpoint:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/health

# Start campaign (requires auth)
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/start-campaign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{
    "campaignId": "test-campaign-id",
    "maxEmailsPerDay": 5
  }'

# Check stats
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/stats?campaignId=test-campaign-id \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

### Step 5.3: Production Dry Run

1. Create test campaign with 10 internal emails
2. Start campaign
3. Monitor for 24 hours
4. Reply to test emails
5. Verify follow-ups cancelled
6. Check all logs and metrics

---

## 📊 PHASE 6: MONITORING SETUP (Day 8)

### Step 6.1: Set Up Slack Alerts (Optional)

1. Create Slack incoming webhook:
   - Go to Slack → Apps → Incoming Webhooks
   - Add to workspace
   - Copy webhook URL

2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   ```

3. Uncomment Slack code in `lib/email-automation/error-handler.ts`

### Step 6.2: Set Up Daily Reports

Create cron job for daily reports:

```json
{
  "path": "/api/email-automation/health?format=report",
  "schedule": "0 18 * * *"
}
```

This sends a daily report at 6 PM.

### Step 6.3: Set Up Error Tracking (Optional)

Install Sentry:

```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs

npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

## 📈 PHASE 8: OPTIMIZATION (Week 3+)

### Step 8.1: Analyze Performance

```sql
-- Check average send time
SELECT 
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (sent_at - scheduled_for))) as avg_delay_seconds
FROM cold_outreach_email_queue
WHERE status = 'sent'
AND sent_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Check response rates by time of day
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sent_at) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as emails_sent,
  COUNT(response_detected_at) as responses,
  (COUNT(response_detected_at)::float / COUNT(*) * 100) as response_rate
FROM cold_outreach_email_queue
WHERE status IN ('sent', 'response_received')
AND sent_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

### Step 8.2: Optimize Send Times

Based on response rate analysis, adjust sending hours:

```sql
UPDATE cold_outreach_campaign_automation
SET 
  sending_start_hour = 10,  -- Best response time
  sending_end_hour = 16
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

### Step 8.3: A/B Testing

Test different:
- Send times
- Follow-up delays
- Email templates
- Subject lines

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Emails not sending

**Check:**
1. Cron job running? `curl /api/email-automation/health`
2. SendGrid API key valid? Test in SendGrid dashboard
3. Emails in queue? Check database
4. Rate limit hit? Check sending_schedule table

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check pending emails
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cold_outreach_email_queue WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Check today's rate limit
SELECT * FROM cold_outreach_sending_schedule WHERE send_date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Manually trigger send (if cron not working)
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/email-automation/send-batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

### Issue: Follow-ups not cancelled

**Check:**
1. Webhook configured? Test with curl
2. Response recorded? Check email_responses table
3. Thread ID matching? Check logs

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Manually cancel follow-ups
SELECT cancel_follow_ups_for_recipient(
  'campaign-id'::uuid,
  'recipient@example.com'
);
```

### Issue: High failure rate

**Check:**
1. SendGrid account status
2. Domain reputation
3. Email content (spam score)
4. Recipient email validity

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check failed emails
SELECT error_message, COUNT(*) 
FROM cold_outreach_email_queue 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
GROUP BY error_message;

-- Move to DLQ for manual review
-- (automatically done by error handler)
```
